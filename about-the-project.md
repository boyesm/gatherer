## Inspiration:

The inspiration for this product came from finding it difficult to quickly find emails for different companies. This started with another project some of us made to get free merch from different companies by emailing them. It took a lot of time to gather these emails, so we wished there was a tool we could use. Some of us have also had jobs where we look for leads for a company, and this involves a lot of searching online for emails.

## What it does:

Makes it easy to find emails for different companies and organizations. It scrapes the internet for emails and stores them in a database. These emails can then be accessed from a website. 

## How we built it:

We spent some time thinking about the different aspects we would need to implement, and came up with web-scraper, database, and website. We set up a MongoDB Atlas server to store our data, and we used Figma to plan our website. We then set up a web scraper in a docker container to run overnight. As that was running, we set up the database endpoints for the website, and created the website. 

## Challenges we ran into:

We got stuck in a few places when it came to the website. We thought that Figma was a tool to make websites, and we would be able to export the project when we were done. We went to the Figma workshop, and spent a lot of time using Figma when that time probably could have been better spent actually coding the website. CSS is also a tricky thing to wrap your head around when you are not used to it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:

We are very proud of the polish of the website, as well as the resiliency of our code. We have run into surprisingly few "catastrophic" bugs that have caused us issues on the front-end. The output on the website side is almost always as expected.

## What we learned:

Different members of our team learned different things. Our team members have different skills, and we leaned on each other to learn new things. The biggest areas of improvement for us have been websites(specifically CSS), databases(We have never used MongoDB before), and the business aspect as well. We feel it is one thing to come up with an idea, but it is an entirely different thing to come up with a marketable idea.

## What's next for Gatherer:

There is definitely room to expand the functionality of this product in the future. We could monetize it by either selling the data we have to companies that want lead and such, and we can also put ads on the page so that we earn money when people use the site. We can also add more information like social media accounts, so you can see the Western email, as well as their Instagram and Twitter.
